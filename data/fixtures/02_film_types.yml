      You can include components in components, or in the global layout, as in any regular
      template. Like actions, components’ execute methods can pass variables to the related partial
      and have access to the same shortcuts. But the similarities stop there. A component doesn’t
      handle security or validation, cannot be called from the Internet (only from the application
      itself), and doesn’t have various return possibilities. That’s why a component is faster to
      execute than an action.

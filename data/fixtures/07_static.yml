      The symfony framework has native support for formats and mime-types. This means that the same Model and Controller can have different templates based on the requested format. The default format is HTML but symfony supports several other formats out of the box like txt, js, css, json, xml, rdf, or atom.
      The format can be set by using the setRequestFormat() method of the request object:
      But most of the time, the format is embedded in the URL. In this case, symfony will set it for you if the special sf_format variable is used in the corresponding route. For the job list, the list URL is:
      http://jobeet.localhost/frontend_dev.php/job
      This URL is equivalent to:
      http://jobeet.localhost/frontend_dev.php/job.html
      Both URLs are equivalent because the routes generated by the sfPropelRouteCollection class have the sf_format as the extension and because html is the default format. You can check it for yourself by running the app:routes task:
    sort: 0
